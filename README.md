## Goals:
1) To further develop my skills in Data Analysis, Web Scraping, Python, PostgreSQL, Jupyter, and Django.
2) To have enough data to be able to predict future scores of English Premier Leauge matches based on the past data...


## Description:
This project will grab data from reliable accurate websites about the English Premier League like players, coaches, results, goals scored, etc. Have that data in a central database, where a website can use that data to get valuable information from it and display it in a visually that allows users to understand the data.
